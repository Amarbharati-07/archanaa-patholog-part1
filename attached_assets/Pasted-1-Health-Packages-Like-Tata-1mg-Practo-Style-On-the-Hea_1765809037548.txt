1️⃣ Health Packages (Like Tata 1mg / Practo Style)

On the Health Packages page, packages must be structured similar to popular Indian lab platforms (e.g., Tata 1mg).

Packages must be clearly categorized into:

Men

Women

Young / General

Senior Citizen

(Optional: Diabetes, Heart, Full Body)

Each package card must display only relevant and clean information:

Package Image

Package Name

Category Tag

Total number of tests included

Report delivery time (e.g., 24–48 hours)

Original Price

Discounted Price

Discount Percentage (e.g., 50% OFF)

⚠️ The discount value must be dynamic, fully controlled from the Admin panel, so the admin can change offers anytime.

Each package card must include:

View Details

Add to Cart

Book Now

No random images, unnecessary buttons, or unrelated UI elements should appear.

When the user clicks View Details, open a modal or page showing all tests included in the package, grouped properly (e.g., CBC, LFT, Thyroid, Lipid, etc.), exactly like professional lab apps.

2️⃣ Complete Cart & Booking Flow

Implement a Cart System with the following behavior:

Users can add individual tests and/or packages to cart

Cart supports multiple items

Real-time price calculation including discounts

Clear summary before payment

When user clicks Proceed to Payment, redirect to payment flow.

🔐 Authentication Rule (Very Important)

Users must NOT be allowed to:

Add to cart

Book tests

Proceed to payment

View reports
without login

If user is not logged in, redirect to Login page

After successful login, resume the same booking/cart flow automatically

3️⃣ Data Security & Access Control

Ensure strict data security:

Booking data, cart data, reports must NOT be accessible without login

Users can see only their own bookings and reports

Admin can see all bookings, payments, reports

No data should be accessible via public or direct routes

No report or booking should appear without authentication

4️⃣ Home Page Improvements

On the Home Page, ensure all major sections are clearly visible and functional:

Featured Health Packages

Popular Lab Tests

Current Offers / Discounts

Easy navigation to Book Test / Packages

If any section is currently hidden, broken, or not loading properly, fix the UI so everything is clean, visible, and user-friendly.

5️⃣ Location-Based Sample Collection (40 KM Rule)

Implement location-based sample collection support:

Allow users to select or share live location

Calculate distance between lab location and user location

If distance exceeds 40 km, clearly restrict or inform user

During booking, clearly show:

Sample collection address

Selected slot

Distance from lab

6️⃣ Admin Panel Enhancements

Admin must be able to:

Create / Edit / Delete health packages

Upload package images

Set prices and discount percentages

Add/remove tests inside packages

Activate / Deactivate packages

View all bookings, users, and payment status

All admin actions must reflect immediately on user side.

7️⃣ ALL INDIA LAB TESTS – MASTER DIRECTORY (MOST IMPORTANT)

Now implement a complete India-standard Lab Test Directory, covering all commonly used pathology tests, especially blood tests, exactly as used in real diagnostic labs.

Organize tests into categories:

Hematology

Biochemistry

Liver Profile (LFT)

Kidney Profile (KFT)

Lipid Profile

Diabetes Tests

Thyroid & Hormones

Vitamins & Minerals

Serology & Immunology

Infection Panels

Cardiac Markers

Special Tests

Each test must be:

Selectable individually

Usable inside packages

8️⃣ Mandatory Report Structure for EVERY Test

For each individual lab test, store and display these medical-standard fields:

Test Name

Test Code (standard lab code)

Sample Type (Blood / Serum / Plasma / Whole Blood)

Fasting Requirement (Yes / No / Hours)

Method Used (e.g., CLIA, ELISA, Spectrophotometry)

Units (mg/dL, g/dL, IU/L, %, cells/µL, etc.)

Reference Range (Male / Female / Age-based where applicable)

Critical Range (if applicable)

Result Field (numeric / text)

Interpretation / Remarks

Report Status (Normal / High / Low / Critical)

The system must automatically determine High / Low / Normal based on reference ranges.

9️⃣ Complete Blood Test Coverage (Indian Standard)

Include full coverage such as:

Hematology

CBC (Hemoglobin, RBC, WBC, Platelets)

HCT / PCV

MCV, MCH, MCHC

RDW

Differential Count

ESR

Peripheral Smear

Blood Group & Rh

Biochemistry

Blood Sugar (Fasting, PP, Random)

HbA1c

Urea

Creatinine

Uric Acid

Electrolytes

Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium

LFT, KFT, Lipid, Thyroid, Hormones, Vitamins, Infection Panels

(Include all commonly used Indian lab tests like Vitamin D, B12, Ferritin, CRP, Dengue, HIV, HBsAg, etc.)

10️⃣ Overall Expectation

This system must behave like a real Indian pathology lab software, not a demo.

Clean & professional UI

Mobile-friendly

Secure authentication

Medical-standard reports

Scalable for future features (PDF reports, doctor remarks, report history, trend comparison)
