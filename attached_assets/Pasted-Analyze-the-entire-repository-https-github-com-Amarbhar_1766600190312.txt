Analyze the entire repository https://github.com/Amarbharati-07/archanaa-patholog-part1 and completely remove .env.example from the project.

Migrate all required environment variables into the actual runtime .env configuration only (development + production), and refactor the backend so that it never depends on .env.example in any way.

Ensure there is only one source of truth for environment variables and that all values are read strictly via process.env.

Detect and fix all issues caused by:

Missing environment variables

Duplicate .env files

Hardcoded credentials

Fallback default values

Incorrect dotenv loading order

Fix the email OTP system completely:

OTP emails must be sent reliably in production (Render + custom domain)

Use Brevo SMTP (non-blocking, async)

Registration API must respond instantly even if email sending is slow

Add proper timeout handling and logging

Fix registration and login flow so that:

Registration does not hang or delay

Clear errors are returned (email exists, OTP invalid, etc.)

JWT, session, and cookies work correctly in production

Fix backend startup logic so that:

App fails fast if required env variables are missing

Logs clearly show which env variables are loaded

No silent failures occur

Fix frontend–backend integration:

Frontend uses the correct API base URL

CORS works with custom domain

OTP verification works on live domain

Fix database access:

Ensure correct DATABASE_URL is used everywhere

Packages, tests, bookings, prescriptions load correctly in production

Remove any environment-based conditional bugs

Final result must be a fully functional production-ready pathology lab website where:

.env.example is removed

Only actual .env files are used

OTP emails are delivered on live domain

Registration and login are fast and stable

No 401 / 403 / 500 errors remain

Deliver:

Updated backend code

Clean .env usage (no example file)

Fixed OTP email logic

Clear explanation of what was broken and how it was fixed

Final project ready to deploy on Render without manual fixes
