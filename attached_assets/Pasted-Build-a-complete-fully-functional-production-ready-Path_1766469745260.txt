Build a complete, fully functional, production-ready Pathology Laboratory Management System named “Archanaa Pathology Lab” for a real diagnostic lab in Maharashtra (Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Kopar) using React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui for frontend and Node.js + Express + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM for backend, with email-OTP authentication, JWT, and strict role-based access (ADMIN & USER). The system must include User Dashboard (register/login via OTP, profile update, book tests & health packages, upload prescription image/PDF, view bookings, view/download reports, payment status) and Admin Dashboard (secure admin login, dashboard analytics, add/edit/delete tests, add/edit/delete health packages, assign multiple tests to packages, upload report PDFs, verify payments, manage users & bookings). Database must be self-healing: auto-create all tables (users, patients, tests, health_packages, package_tests, bookings, reports, prescriptions) and required columns (image_url, profile_photo, prescription_path) if missing, seed sample data safely only when tables are empty, and never crash due to missing schema. All APIs must return safe JSON with proper HTTP codes and no 500 errors for empty data. Health package details must correctly show all included tests, admin edit options must always appear for admins, and frontend must never show blank pages or empty modals. Include Razorpay integration with auto-disable if keys are missing. Configure PWA properly with valid manifest.webmanifest, working sw.js, correct icons (192×192, 512×512), no console warnings, and domain-ready SPA routing. Provide a correct package.json, build scripts that work on Render, environment variable support, and a deployment-ready setup that runs cleanly on https://archanapathalogy.in. Deliver the complete project structure, backend, frontend, database schema, seed logic, APIs, UI, and configs, fully working end-to-end with no placeholders and no assumptions, suitable for real lab usage.
