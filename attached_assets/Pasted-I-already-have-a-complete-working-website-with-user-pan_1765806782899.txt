I already have a complete working website with user panel and admin panel, and the project is already developed inside a single full-stack folder (React + backend together). This is my existing GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Amarbharati-07/archanaa-patholog-part1

You must work strictly inside this project only. Do not create a new project, do not separate frontend and backend, and do not change the existing tech stack or authentication flow.

First requirement is to implement live location–based sample collection. When a user books a lab test or health package, the system should automatically fetch the user’s current location using browser location permission. The distance between the lab/shop location and the user location must be calculated in real time. If the distance is within 40 km, sample collection should be allowed. If the distance is more than 40 km, booking should be blocked with a clear message saying that sample collection is not available beyond 40 km. The lab/shop location must be configurable from the admin panel, not hardcoded.

On the booking page, the user should clearly see the distance from the lab, for example “Distance from lab: 12.3 km – Sample collection available” or “Sample collection not available beyond 40 km”. If possible, also show a simple map view with user location and lab location pins, only for visual clarity (map is optional, distance logic is mandatory).

Next requirement is to add health packages similar to Tata 1mg or Pharmeasy. Health packages should be categorized properly as Men, Women, and Young/General. Each package must have a package name, category, list of tests included, report time (for example 18–24 hours), original price, discount percentage (like 50%), and final discounted price. The UI should clearly show the discount, such as original price crossed out and discounted price highlighted. When the user clicks on a package, a detailed view or modal should open showing all included tests grouped logically (for example CBC, LFT, Thyroid, etc.).

All pricing and offers must be fully controlled from the admin panel. Admin should be able to create, edit, or delete health packages, set original price, set discount percentage, enable or disable offers, and the system should automatically calculate the final price. No offer or price should be hardcoded in the frontend.

On the booking summary and confirmation page, show complete details including patient name, selected health package or test, sample collection address, selected time slot, distance from lab, and final payable amount after discount. This should look clean and professional, similar to the screenshots I shared earlier.

All these features must be implemented without breaking any existing functionality. The website should remain fully responsive for mobile and desktop users. Follow the existing project structure, database, routing, and coding style. If anything is unclear, ask before making structural changes. The goal is to enhance the existing system, not rebuild it.
