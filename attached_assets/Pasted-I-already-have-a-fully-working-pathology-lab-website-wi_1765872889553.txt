I already have a fully working pathology lab website with health packages and individual lab tests displayed in card format on the Home page, Featured Packages section, Popular Tests section, and the main Health Packages listing page. Now I want to enhance the user experience by adding proper, meaningful, and visually appealing images to every package and test card so that users can instantly understand the test or package by looking at the image and feel encouraged to click and book.

Each health package card should display a relevant medical image based on the package type, such as full body checkup, men’s health, women’s health, heart health, diabetes care, senior citizen care, or general wellness. Similarly, every individual lab test card should show a small but clear image related to the test category, for example blood test visuals for CBC and blood sugar, heart icons for cardiac tests, thyroid visuals for thyroid tests, kidney or liver illustrations for KFT and LFT, urine sample visuals for urine tests, and vitamin or hormone related visuals where applicable. These images must look professional, medical-grade, and consistent across the platform.

Images should be placed at the top of each card with proper aspect ratio, rounded corners, and subtle shadow, without breaking the existing layout. The image must not overcrowd the card and should visually guide the user’s attention toward the package name, price, discount badge, and Book Now button. If an image is not available for a specific test or package, a clean default medical placeholder image should be used instead.

The system must allow the admin to manage images from the admin panel. Admin should be able to upload, update, or change the image for any test or package at any time without code changes. Image URLs should be stored securely and fetched dynamically so that UI updates instantly reflect admin changes.

The goal of this enhancement is to make the website feel similar to top Indian diagnostic platforms, improve visual clarity, increase click-through rate, and make booking faster and more intuitive for users by using images as visual cues. The overall design must remain clean, fast-loading, mobile-friendly, and professional, without affecting existing booking, cart, payment, or authentication logic.
