I already have a working pathology lab website with proper user and admin roles implemented, and now I want to convert it into a complete, real-world Indian pathology lab system similar to platforms like Tata 1mg or Practo, without breaking any existing functionality. On the Health Packages page, health packages must be professionally structured and categorized into Men, Women, Young/General, and Senior Citizen (optionally Diabetes, Heart, Full Body). Each package card should display only relevant information such as package image, package name, category tag, total number of tests included, report delivery time, original price, discounted price, and dynamic discount percentage like 50% OFF, where the discount value is fully configurable from the admin panel at any time. Every package card must contain View Details, Add to Cart, and Book Now buttons, and no random images or unnecessary UI elements should appear. Clicking View Details should open a modal or page that clearly lists all included tests grouped logically (CBC, LFT, Thyroid, Lipid, etc.) exactly like professional lab applications. A complete cart system must be implemented where users can add individual lab tests or full packages, see real-time price calculation with discounts, and proceed to payment, but strictly no cart, booking, or payment action should be allowed without login; if a user is not logged in, they must be redirected to the login page and after successful login the same booking flow should resume automatically. Booking data, cart data, and medical reports must never be publicly accessible, users should only see their own bookings and reports, admins should see all data, and no data should be accessible through direct routes without authentication. The home page must properly display featured health packages, popular lab tests, current offers or discounts, and clear navigation to book tests or packages, fixing any existing UI issues where sections are not visible or user-friendly. Location-based sample collection must be supported, allowing users to share or select their live location, calculating distance from the lab, restricting or informing users if the address is beyond a 40 km radius, and clearly showing sample collection address and slot during booking. The admin panel must allow admins to create, edit, delete, activate, or deactivate health packages, upload package images, configure prices and discount percentages, manage test lists inside packages, and view all bookings, users, and payment statuses with changes reflecting instantly on the user side. A master India-standard lab test directory must be implemented covering all commonly used pathology and blood tests in India, organized into categories like Hematology, Biochemistry, Liver Profile, Kidney Profile, Lipid Profile, Diabetes, Thyroid & Hormones, Vitamins & Minerals, Serology & Immunology, Infection Panels, Cardiac Markers, and Special Tests, where each test can be booked individually or included in packages. Every lab test must follow a proper medical report structure including test name, test code, sample type, fasting requirement, method used, units, reference range (male/female/age-based where applicable), critical range if applicable, result field, interpretation or remarks, and automatic status marking as Normal, High, Low, or Critical. Complete blood test coverage must be included such as CBC and all its parameters, ESR, blood group, blood sugar variants, HbA1c, urea, creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes, calcium, LFT, KFT, lipid profile, thyroid tests, hormonal tests, vitamin and mineral tests, and infection tests like CRP, Dengue, HIV, HBsAg, etc., exactly as used in real Indian diagnostic labs. Overall, the system must behave like a real pathology lab software with clean, professional, mobile-friendly UI, secure authentication, medical-standard reports, and scalable architecture ready for future features like PDF reports, doctor remarks, report history, and trend comparison.
