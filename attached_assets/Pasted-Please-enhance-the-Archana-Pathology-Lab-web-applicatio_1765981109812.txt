Please enhance the Archana Pathology Lab web application to make it fully production-ready and user-friendly, similar to platforms like 1mg and PharmEasy. On the Home Page, add a prominent “Upload Prescription & Book Test” section where users can upload a doctor’s prescription (PDF/JPG/PNG) directly from the home page and proceed to test or health package booking, with the prescription automatically attached to the booking and visible to the admin. Also add a background promotional video banner on the home page (15–20 seconds, auto-play, muted, looped) showcasing lab services, accuracy, doorstep sample collection, and trust, with CTA buttons like “Upload Prescription” and “Book a Test” overlayed on the video. In the booking flow, allow users to optionally upload a prescription while booking single tests or health packages, ensuring the file is securely stored and linked to the specific order. On the User Dashboard, implement a complete My Orders / History section showing all booked tests and packages with booking date, test/package names, booking status (Pending, Sample Collected, Report Generated, Completed), payment status, amount paid, and payment method, along with the ability to view and download payment receipts/invoices (PDF) for each order. Add a Medical Records / Documents section where users can see all uploaded prescriptions and generated test reports with view and download options. Allow users to manage their profile, including uploading a profile photo and updating name and phone number, while keeping email ID non-editable. Ensure admins can clearly see user profile details, uploaded prescriptions, complete booking and payment history, and generate reports easily for each booked test without confusion. All data (tests, packages, bookings, prescriptions, reports, receipts, profile images) must be properly stored in the main database, persist correctly in production hosting (not temporary Replit data), and display consistently on both local and hosted environments. Implement proper validations, secure file handling, role-based access (user/admin), and ensure the home page, tests page, packages page, and view-details modals always fetch live database data and never show empty content after deployment. The final system should deliver a smooth end-to-end experience from home page prescription upload and video promotion to booking, payment, report generation, and user history tracking without any broken flows.
