You are a senior full-stack engineer.

I am sharing my existing project repository:
https://github.com/Amarbharati-07/archanaa-patholog-part1

This is a production project already deployed on Render with PostgreSQL (Neon).
Your task is NOT to create a new app, but to FIX, ALIGN, and COMPLETE the existing system.

========================
TECH STACK (ALREADY USED)
========================
Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: PostgreSQL (Neon)
ORM/Query: SQL (existing queries)
Auth: Email OTP + Firebase (already configured)
Deployment: Render

========================
CRITICAL PROBLEMS TO FIX
========================

1️⃣ TESTS DATA ISSUE
- Database table `tests` has ~76 records
- API `/api/tests` returns correct count
- BUT Admin Dashboard → Tests page shows "No Tests Yet"
- FIX:
  - Ensure GET `/api/tests` returns correct JSON
  - Fix frontend query mapping
  - Ensure category, price, code fields are rendered
  - Remove any wrong filters or status checks
  - Tests MUST display in Admin UI and Public UI

2️⃣ HEALTH PACKAGES CONTENT ISSUE
- Health packages are visible
- BUT:
  - Included tests are NOT showing
  - Package details modal is empty or partial
- FIX:
  - Correct backend JOIN between:
    health_packages ↔ package_tests ↔ tests
  - API `/api/health-packages/:id` MUST return:
    {
      id,
      name,
      description,
      category,
      originalPrice,
      discountedPrice,
      discountPercentage,
      reportTime,
      tests: [ full test objects ]
    }

3️⃣ EDIT PACKAGE OPTION NOT SHOWING
- Admin dashboard → Health Packages
- Edit (✏️) button NOT visible or NOT working
- FIX:
  - Add Edit icon/button
  - Clicking Edit opens modal with:
    - package name
    - category
    - description
    - prices
    - discount
    - report time
    - selected tests (checkbox list)
    - active/inactive toggle
  - Pre-fill existing values
  - PATCH `/api/health-packages/:id` must update correctly

4️⃣ ICON ERROR (CRITICAL FRONTEND CRASH)
- Error:
  "FlaskConical is not defined"
- FIX:
  - Correct lucide-react imports
  - Ensure all icons used are imported
  - Remove unused icon references
  - App MUST NOT crash in production build

5️⃣ DATABASE SCHEMA MISMATCH
- Backend expects columns like:
  profile_photo / profilePhoto
- But database column does not exist
- FIX:
  - Either:
    A) Add missing columns using SQL migration
    OR
    B) Remove column usage from queries
- Ensure DB schema & backend queries MATCH 100%

6️⃣ API ERROR HANDLING
- Replace generic 400/500 errors with:
  - Clear JSON messages
  - Proper HTTP status codes
- Example:
  - "Email already registered"
  - "Phone already registered"
  - "Invalid OTP"
- No silent failures

7️⃣ ADMIN ↔ PUBLIC DATA SYNC
- Tests added in Admin → must appear in:
  - Public Tests page
  - Health Package selection
- Packages updated → reflect immediately

8️⃣ UI CONSISTENCY FIX
- Ensure:
  - Test count matches DB
  - Package test count accurate
  - Empty state only when truly empty
  - Loading skeletons handled correctly

========================
STRICT REQUIREMENTS
========================
✔ Do NOT remove existing features  
✔ Do NOT change routing structure unnecessarily  
✔ Do NOT break Render deployment  
✔ Use existing folder structure  
✔ Keep environment variables unchanged  
✔ Code must be PRODUCTION READY  
✔ NO console errors  
✔ NO runtime crashes  

========================
DELIVERABLES
========================
1. Updated backend APIs (Express)
2. Fixed SQL queries (with joins)
3. Corrected React components
4. Fixed Admin UI (Tests + Packages)
5. Proper Edit Package workflow
6. Final folder structure ready for GitHub push

========================
OUTPUT FORMAT
========================
- Provide COMPLETE updated files
- Clearly mention:
  - Which files changed
  - What was fixed
- Code must run directly after:
  npm install
  npm run build
  npm start

Proceed step-by-step and verify each fix logically before moving to the next.
